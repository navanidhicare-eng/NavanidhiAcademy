The exam results saving functionality has a critical backend bug where result variable is referenced before declaration at line 6251 in server/routes.ts. This causes:

Data gets saved to the database successfully (confirmed by logs)
Backend error prevents proper response formation
Frontend cache doesn't update due to malformed response
UI continues showing "Pending" instead of "Submitted"
Technical Details
Database Column: The marks_obtained column in the exam_results table stores the total marks.

Error Location: server/routes.ts line 6251 in the bulk exam results update endpoint.

Root Cause: Variable result is being used before it's declared/defined in the backend response handling.

Required Fixes
1. Backend Fix (Priority: CRITICAL)
File: server/routes.ts around line 6251

Issue: Fix the ReferenceError: result is not defined error by properly declaring and initializing the result variable before use.

Expected Behavior:

Properly format response with calculated percentage
Include all necessary data for frontend cache update
Handle the marks_obtained column correctly
2. Frontend Cache Update (Priority: HIGH)
File: client/src/pages/so-center/PostExamResult.tsx

Issue: The existingResults query cache isn't being invalidated/updated properly after successful saves.

Expected Behavior:

Update the existingResults cache with new data immediately after save
Change status from "Pending" to "Completed" based on marks_obtained > 0
Disable edit buttons for submitted students
3. Status Logic (Priority: MEDIUM)
Function: getStudentStatus() in PostExamResult.tsx

Current Logic:

const getStudentStatus = (studentId: string) => {
  const result = getStudentResult(studentId);
  if (result && result.marksObtained !== undefined && result.marksObtained !== null && result.marksObtained > 0) {
    return 'Completed';
  }
  return 'Pending';
};
Issue: This logic is correct but relies on properly updated cache data.

Implementation Steps
Fix Backend Error:

Locate the bulk update endpoint in routes.ts
Find where result is referenced before declaration
Properly initialize the variable with calculated percentage
Ensure response includes marks_obtained, percentage, and status
Verify Database Schema:

Confirm exam_results.marks_obtained column exists and is integer type
Ensure proper data is being inserted
Update Frontend Cache:

Fix the onSuccess callback in saveResultMutation
Properly invalidate and update the existingResults query
Ensure UI reflects the new status immediately
Test Workflow:

Save exam results should work without errors
UI should immediately show "Completed" status
Edit button should be disabled for submitted students
Page refresh should maintain the correct status
Expected Outcome
After implementing these fixes:

✅ No more backend errors in console
✅ Exam results save successfully
✅ UI immediately shows "Submitted" status
✅ Students cannot edit results after submission
✅ SO Center managers see accurate submission status
Debug Information
Console shows: 💾 Saving bulk exam results with minimal schema (production optimized)
Error occurs: ❌ Database error for student: [id] ReferenceError: result is not defined
Data actually saves but response is malformed
Frontend receives incomplete response and cannot update UI
This is a critical production issue that affects the exam management workflow for SO Centers.
