"I need you to enhance the Academic Admin Dashboard to include proper navigation links to existing academic management pages. The system currently has an Academic Dashboard with only 2 tabs (Student Progress and Attendance Reports), but it needs to be expanded to include navigation to key academic management pages.

Current Situation:

AcademicDashboard.tsx exists with basic Student Progress and Attendance Reports tabs
The following academic admin pages already exist and are functional:
ClassSubjectManagement.tsx - For managing classes and subjects
TopicsManagement.tsx - For managing chapters and topics
Required Changes:

Update client/src/pages/admin/AcademicDashboard.tsx:

Keep existing Student Progress and Attendance Reports tabs
Add a navigation section with cards/buttons to access academic management pages
Create an Academic Management section that provides easy access to:
Class & Subject Management
Topics Management (Chapters & Topics)
Academic Dashboard Structure to Implement:

Student Progress Tab (Keep existing functionality with location filters)
Attendance Reports Tab (Keep existing functionality with center-wise reports)
Academic Management Section with navigation cards for:
Class & Subject Management (/admin/class-subject-management)
Topics Management (/admin/topics-management)
Technical Requirements:

Use React Router navigation (useLocation from wouter)
Add navigation cards with proper routing
Include icons from Lucide React (BookOpen, Target)
Maintain responsive design with Tailwind CSS
Use existing UI components (Card, Button)
Add descriptive text for each management section
Include proper accessibility attributes
Design Pattern:

// Add navigation cards for academic management
const academicSections = [
  {
    title: 'Class & Subject Management',
    description: 'Manage classes and subjects',
    icon: BookOpen,
    path: '/admin/class-subject-management'
  },
  {
    title: 'Topics Management', 
    description: 'Manage chapters and topics',
    icon: Target,
    path: '/admin/topics-management'
  }
];
Key Implementation Points:

Import useLocation from wouter for navigation
Add navigation cards above or below the existing tabs
Ensure all existing functionality remains intact (Student Progress and Attendance Reports)
Use consistent styling with existing dashboard
Add loading states if needed
Include proper error handling
Expected Outcome:
An enhanced Academic Admin Dashboard that serves as a central hub for academic monitoring (Student Progress and Attendance Reports) while providing easy navigation to Class & Subject Management and Topics Management pages. The dashboard should maintain all existing functionality while adding seamless navigation to these key academic management functions."
