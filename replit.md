# Navanidhi Academy Management System

## Overview

This is a comprehensive educational management system designed for Navanidhi Academy and its satellite office (SO) centers. The application provides role-based access control for different user types including admins, SO center managers, teachers, and agents. The system focuses on student tracking through QR codes, academic progress monitoring, payment management, and wallet transactions. Students do not have login access - all tracking is managed by SO centers and accessible to parents via QR codes.
